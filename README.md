## Description

This study guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the prework.  It contains notes such as descriptions and details on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and git.  The purposed of this study-guide was for  students to review the main ideas of the formers in a quick and organized manner. 
Some of the problems solve in this guide were but not limited to adding documentation of the process of learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and git.
while Learning to build this short application, I  discover how HTML, CSS, JavaScript and git/github relate and play each a role in website development, as well as to access the repository in a local computer and remotely using git and VS code.  Last, I learned to test this application for debugging by looking at it live in my browser and through DevTools.
